# Airbnb Price Prediction
- Preprocessed an Airbnb listings dataset by applying feature engineering techniques (median imputation, winsorization, and one-hot encoding)
- Created training and test sets from labeled examples for supervised learning model development
- Developed and compared regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees) to predict Airbnb listing prices
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R2 metrics, identifying Gradient Boosted Decision Trees as the top performing model
